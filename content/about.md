### Researcher. Developer. Designer.

I am a second year MSc in Computer Science student at ETH Zurich, currently pursuing my masters thesis in collaboration with Microsoft Mixed Reality and AI research lab, Zurich.

I am a keen Machine Learning and Computer Vision enthusiast. I am interested in solving challenging problems in the domain of scene understanding and localisation. I strongly believe advancements in these fields will transform how we currently perceive our surroundings.

In the past, I spent some wonderful time at Astrivis and Microsoft, learning new tech stuff and improving my dev skills. I did my bachelors from IIT Mandi and moved to Zurich after staying in Hyderabad for a couple of years.

Personally, I love to travel and explore new places. I often spend my free time sketching or in DIY art. I am trying to adopt a workout schedule and would love to bike around Zurich more often.
