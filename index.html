<p>I spent my 2016 summers as a Software Engineering Intern with <strong>SPACE TELESCOPE AND SCIENCE INSTITUTE, NASA | MARYLAND, USA</strong>. During those 8 weeks I worked with WFC3 group of Hubble Space Telescope on 3D-HST Project and created the DB, API and Web Interface of the entire dataset for this Hubble Project. (Paper in preparation )</p>

<p>My final year major technical project is on <strong>ANALYZING AND DEVELOPING SPATIAL DATABASES FOR ASTRONOMICAL DATASETS</strong> which I'm working on with my mentors Dr. Sriram Kailasam (IIT Mandi, India) and Dr. Ivelina Momcheva (STScI, USA). The main gist of the project is to analyze the issues with current spatial and non-spatial querying DB and develop a unified framework for astronomical data processing</p>
