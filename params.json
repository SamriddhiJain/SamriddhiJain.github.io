During those 8 weeks I worked with WFC3 group of Hubble Space Telescope on 3D-HST Project and created the DB, API and Web Interface of the entire dataset for this Hubble Project. (Paper in preparation )\r\n\r\n### Research Work\r\nMy final year major technical project is on **ANALYZING AND DEVELOPING SPATIAL DATABASES FOR ASTRONOMICAL DATASETS** which I'm working on with my mentors Dr. Sriram Kailasam (IIT Mandi, India) and Dr. Ivelina Momcheva (STScI, USA). The main gist of the project is to analyze the issues with current spatial and non-spatial querying DB and\r\ndevelop a unified framework for astronomical data processing\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\nIn the past 2-3 years I have done many interesting projects, some of them listed as below:\r\n* NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING FOR NEWS-TWEETS INTEGRATION\r\n   * Detected semantic correspondences between news and tweets, used it for social media analysis.\r\n   * Presented at Inter IIT Tech meet, won silver medal.\r\n* ANALYTICAL AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF SCIDB\r\n   * Understanding the use of SciDb in multidimensional data storage and analytics in the scientific community.\r\n   * Study key differences between RDBMS and SciDB for various tasks\r\n* NETWORK MONITORING AND REMOTE MANAGEMENT\r\n   * Used Nagios for Network management and monitoring of important institute services to get usage patterns and dividing network bandwidth accordingly.\r\n* COLLABORATIVE REAL-TIME TEXT EDITOR\r\n   * A text editor to be used over multiple systems (browser based) and for collaborative editing of the text documents.\r\n* APACHE SPARK CLUSTER COMPUTING FRAMEWORK\r\n   * Understanding the key characteristics of Apache Spark framework that make it superior to their traditional counterparts like Hadoop, MapReduce.\r\n\r\n### Awards (move to top)\r\n* Space Telescope and Science Instituteâ€™s SASP-2016 Scholar\r\n* Silver Medal, 4th Inter IIT Tech Meet-2016, Pan-IIT competition for social media analysis\r\n* 2nd Prize Space Quiz, IIT KGP, NSSC-2014, won this prize while in a National Space Quiz\r\n* 2nd Runner Up, Manthan CAG-2013, won in policy making for unskilled workforce in India.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nIf you have any suggestions or interested in a quick chit-chat, feel free to contact me at any of these places.\r\nayushyadav@outlook.com | +91 981 692 3909\r\nhttps://in.linkedin.com/in/akyiit | https://github.com/AyushYadav \r\n",
